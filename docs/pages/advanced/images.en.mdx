# Utility Images

We provide some utility container images to make it easier for users to use Seele.

## `diff-scripts` image

The source files for the image are located at [images/diff-scripts](https://github.com/darkyzhou/seele/tree/main/images/diff-scripts). You can reference this image in the judge task using `image: darkyzhou/diff-scripts`.

`diff-scripts` provides two script files, `diff-strict` and `diff-loose`, for comparing the differences between the output content of the judge program and the standard answer content. They are based on GNU diffutils.

### `diff-strict`

Checks if the contents of the `user.out` and `standard.out` files in the current directory are exactly the same.

- If there are differences other than trailing whitespace characters and differing numbers of whitespace characters, the exit code is `8`.
- If there are _only_ differences in trailing whitespace characters or differing numbers of whitespace characters, the exit code is `9`.
- If there are no differences, the exit code is `0`.
- If the file does not exist, the exit code is `1`.

### `diff-loose`

Checks if the contents of the `user.out` and `standard.out` files in the current directory are _basically_ the same.

- If there are differences other than trailing whitespace characters, differing numbers of whitespace characters, and differing numbers of empty lines, the exit code is `8`.
- If there are no such differences, the exit code is `0`.
- If the file does not exist, the exit code is `1`.

### Usage

The script files always use the `user.out` file in the current directory as the output content of the judge program and the `standard.out` as the standard answer content. When using the [execution task](/tasks/judge), we can modify the mounted file names using the `files` attribute.

The following example demonstrates the usage of `diff-loose`, and the usage of `diff-strict` is similar. In this example, we redirect the output stream of the judge program to the file `__user_output`, and then mount it along with the answer file `__answer` in the utility image for comparison.

```yaml
steps:
  run:
    # ...
    fd:
      stdout: "__user_output"

  compare:
    action: "seele/run-judge/run@1"
    image: "harbor.matrix.moe/docker.io/darkyzhou/diff-scripts"
    command: "diff-loose"
    files:
      - "__user_output:user.out"
      - "__answer:standard.out"
```
