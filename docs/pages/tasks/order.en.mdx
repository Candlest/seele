# Control Execution

Sequential tasks can execute their subtasks in a certain order, defined by `steps`. By default, sequential tasks execute each subtask in the order they appear. When a subtask fails and enters the [`FAILED`](/tasks/states) state, the sequential task stops executing and sets the remaining subtask states to `SKIPPED`. To allow users to model more complex task execution flows, Seele provides two attributes to change the default behavior: `when` and `needs`.

## `when`

Accepts a string, with possible values: `true` or `previous.ok`. The default value is `previous.ok`.

When a subtask in a sequential task fails, Seele checks the `when` value of its successor nodes. By default, `previous.ok` means that the current node will only continue to run if the predecessor node executes successfully. Setting it to `true` allows Seele to execute the current node even if the predecessor node fails.

## `needs`

Accepts a string specifying the name of the predecessor task as a subtask in the sequential task.

By default, sequential tasks execute subtasks in the order they are declared. Each subtask's predecessor node is the task immediately preceding it. For example, in the following case, the `one`, `two`, and `three` subtasks will be executed in order, as shown in the diagram below.

```yaml
steps:
  one: # ...
  two: # ...
  three: # ...
```

By adding `when: one` to the `three` configuration, we change the predecessor node of `three` from `two` to `one`. Now, the execution order of the sequential task changes. It still starts with `one`, but then **concurrently executes** `two` and `three`. Their relationship is shown in the diagram below.

When used with `when`, `previous.ok` points to the state of its predecessor task, i.e., the task specified by `when`. `when` can only specify the names of tasks declared before it. For example, in the above case, we **cannot** use `when: three` in `two`.
