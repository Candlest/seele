# Task States

The execution states of sequential tasks, concurrent tasks, and action tasks are shown in the diagram below.

- Each task is in the `PENDING` state after it is created, indicating that it is waiting for execution.
- When a task cannot be executed due to the failure of its predecessor node or the relationship specified by [`when`](/tasks/order) is not satisfied, it will be set to the `SKIPPED` state.
- When the task is completed, it will be set to the `SUCCESS` state if the execution is successful, otherwise, it will be set to the `FAILED` state.
