# Root Folder

For each judge task, Seele creates a folder on tmpfs for all subtasks to access, which we refer to as the "root folder." For example, when Seele performs an [Add File](/tasks/files) action, the file is actually saved to the root folder. When [running the judge program](/tasks/judge), the files mounted in the container also come from the root folder.

Placing the root folder on tmpfs is mainly to reduce the impact of IO factors on the efficiency of running judge programs. For more information, see [Fairness](/advanced/fairness).

<Callout type="info">
  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that no duplicate files appear in
  the root folder. Seele does not check whether it is overwriting an existing
  file when writing a new one.
