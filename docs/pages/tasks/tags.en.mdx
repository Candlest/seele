# Tags

To meet the needs of some scenarios, we can attach tags to subtasks in the judge tasks using `tags`. These tags will be preserved as-is in the corresponding judge reports. `tags` accepts a dictionary with string key-value pairs.

In the example below, we run a task to add a file and use `tags` to attach some tags.

```yaml
steps:
  prepare:
    tags:
      foo: "bar"
      message: "hello"
    action: "seele/add-file@1"
    files:
      - path: "main.py"
        plain: |
          print(f"{1/0}")
```

Seele will preserve the tags we provided in the corresponding judge reports (including progress reports and completed reports), as shown below:

```json
{
  "id": "QqmPeQrUFsrLAULA",
  "type": "COMPLETED",
  "report_at": "2023-03-26T03:29:15.388936921Z",
  "status": {
    "submitted_at": "2023-03-26T03:29:15.387603442Z",
    "id": "QqmPeQrUFsrLAULA",
    "steps": {
      "prepare": {
        "tags": {
          "foo": "bar",
          "message": "hello"
        },
        "status": "SUCCESS",
        "report": {
          "run_at": "2023-03-26T03:29:15.388262860Z",
          "time_elapsed_ms": 0,
          "type": "add_file"
        },
        "embeds": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
