# Composer Configuration

Composer is responsible for receiving judge tasks from Exchange, parsing the tasks, and generating a multi-branch tree composed of steps. It then sends the steps from the root of the tree to the Worker and tracks the execution of the steps.

Composer currently does not have any configuration options.
