# Local Development

It is recommended to use a distribution with a newer kernel, such as Archlinux, for local development. Local development only requires a regular user, not `root` privileges.

## Environment Requirements

- Golang 1.19
- Cargo 1.69.0+
- rustc 1.69.0+

## Debugging the Security Sandbox

There is a `Makefile` in the `runj` folder. You can build the sandbox and save the executable file to `runj/bin` by running `make build`.

For integration tests, you need to prepare the `gcc:11-bullseye` image file in the `runj/tests/image` folder. Then, run `pnpm install` and `node run.mjs` in the `runj/tests` folder to start the integration tests.

## Debugging the Judge Service

The Seele repository provides a `Dockerfile.dev` for local development packaging. You can build Seele, including the judge service program and the sandbox program, by running `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`. After the build is complete, you can start Seele following the [Docker Deployment](/getting-started) method.

If you want to use a debugger or start the judge service directly with `cargo run`, follow the steps below:

- On Archlinux, you need to install additional packages `systemd-libs` and `protobuf`. On Ubuntu, you need to install additional packages `libsystemd-dev` and `protobuf-compiler`.
- Refer to the configuration file below:

```toml copy filename="config.toml"
log_level = "info"
work_mode = "bare"

[paths]
root = '/home/user/seele/root'
runj = '/home/user/seele/runj/bin/runj'

[worker.action.run_container]
userns_uid = 1000
userns_user = "user"
userns_gid = 1000
userns_group = "user"
```
