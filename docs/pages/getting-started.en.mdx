# Quick Start

## System Requirements

<Callout type="info">
  If you're not familiar with these requirements, we recommend using [Ubuntu
  22.04](https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) or a later version, as this
  distribution meets the conditions listed below.
</Callout>

Seele is based on the container technology and Rootless Containers technology provided by the Linux kernel, which requires the Linux system to meet the following conditions.

- At least 4 CPU cores and 4 GiB or more of memory.
- Linux kernel version at least `5.11` or higher, with newer versions recommended for security vulnerability fixes and stability improvements.
- [Control Group v2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) enabled by default instead of v1.
- At least one regular user, with [corresponding `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` configured](https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/subuid/).
- If running as a regular user, Systemd version 243 or higher is required, with [relevant delegation enabled](https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/cgroup2/#enabling-cpu-cpuset-and-io-delegation).

<Callout type="info">
We recommend creating a dedicated user account for Seele to ensure that it has low permissions and a small impact on the system:
```sh
adduser --no-create-home --disabled-login --disabled-password --gecos "" seele
```

The installation steps below assume the use of the `seele` user and group, with both uid and gid set to `1000`.

</Callout>

## Installation Steps

Seele supports running in various environments, including bare-metal deployment, Docker deployment, and Kubernetes deployment, with Docker deployment being the simplest method.

<Tabs items={['Docker Deployment', 'Bare-metal Deployment', 'Kubernetes Deployment']} storageKey="selected-installation-method">
  <Tab>
    Next, we will use the current directory as the storage directory for Seele's configuration files, image files, and other files. Prepare a configuration file named `config.toml` in the current directory, with the following content:

    ```toml copy filename="config.toml"
    # Configure the judge system to run an Http service on port 8080 to receive our judge tasks
    [exchange.demo]
    type = "http"
    address = "0.0.0.0"
    port = 8080

    # The security sandbox needs to know which user to use to create containers, plus the id of a group that the user is in.
    # Please make sure you have corresponding `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` configured for the user.
    [worker.action.run_container]
    userns_user = "seele"
    userns_uid = 1000
    userns_gid = 1000
    ```

    Run the following command using Docker. Wait for Docker to download the image and start Seele.

    <Callout type="info">
      Please use the latest version of Docker as much as possible to avoid issues with unsupported features.
    </Callout>

    ```sh copy
    docker run \
      --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
      --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
      --security-opt systempaths=unconfined \
      -v /etc/subuid:/etc/subuid \
      -v /etc/subgid:/etc/subgid \
      -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup \
      -v `pwd`:/etc/seele \
      --tmpfs /tmp:exec,mode=777,size=1G \
      --cgroupns host \
      --net host \
      ghcr.io/darkyzhou/seele
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  The documentation for bare-metal deployment is still being written.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  The documentation for Kubernetes deployment is still being written.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When Seele runs successfully, you will see an output similar to the following:

```log
2023-03-25T02:57:16.048480Z  INFO seele:154: Checking cpu counts
2023-03-25T02:57:16.048882Z  INFO seele:167: Checking id maps

2023-03-25T02:57:16.050962Z  INFO seele::exchange::http:27: Starting http exchange demo on 0.0.0.0:23335
```

We've prepared a simple judge task that adds a `main.py` source file and uses the official Python image to run the source file and get the output.
For convenience, we'll save this file as `task.yaml`.

```yaml copy filename="task.yaml"
steps:
  prepare:
    action: "seele/add-file@1"
    files:
      - path: "main.py"
        plain: |
          print("Hello, world!")

  run:
    action: "seele/run-judge/run@1"
    image: "python:alpine"
    command: "python main.py"
    files: ["main.py"]
    fd:
      # Redirect the stdout stream to a file called `out.txt`
      stdout: "out.txt"
    report:
      embeds:
        # Instruct seele to save the content from `out.txt`
        - path: "out.txt"
          field: output
          truncate_kib: 8
```

Using a tool like `curl`, we can send a request containing the judge task to Seele's Http service:

```sh copy
curl --data-binary @task.yaml http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

After Seele receives this judge task, it will attempt to connect to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to download the official Python image and run the task.
If everything goes smoothly, and your network can access Docker Hub without any issues, you'll quickly get a result similar to the following:

```jsonc

  "type": "COMPLETED",
